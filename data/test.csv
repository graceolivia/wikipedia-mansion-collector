The building contains a marble facade with a copper cornice above the 20th story. The windows are grouped into recessed bays, separated horizontally by metal spandrels and vertically by narrow piers. The base contains part of a flagship store for Nordstrom, which extends into Central Park Tower and another building.
5 Columbus Circle was originally built as the headquarters of the United States Rubber Company (U.S. Rubber) in 1912. It was part of Broadway's ""Automobile Row"" during the early 20th century. U.S. Rubber moved to a new headquarters in 1940, and the building was sold several times before being acquired by the West Side Federal Savings and Loan Association. The First Nationwide Savings Bank, which acquired the West Side Federal Savings bank, sold the building in 1985 to John Phufas and John O'Donnell, and small renovations were undertaken in subsequent years.

It runs between Broadway in the west to South Street and the East River in the east. The term ""Wall Street"" has become a metonym for the financial markets of the United States as a whole, the American financial services industry, New York–based financial interests, or the Financial District itself.
Wall Street was originally known in Dutch as ""de Waalstraat"" when it was part of New Amsterdam in the 17th century, though the origins of the name vary. An actual wall existed on the street from 1685 to 1699. During the 17th century, Wall Street was a slave trading marketplace and a securities trading site, as well as the location of Federal Hall, New York's first city hall. In the early 19th century, both residences and businesses occupied the area, but increasingly business predominated, and New York City's financial industry became centered on Wall Street. In the 20th century, several early skyscrapers were built on Wall Street, including 40 Wall Street, once the world's tallest building.
Wall Street is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Several other major exchanges have or had headquarters in the Wall Street area, including the New York Mercantile Exchange, the New York Board of Trade, the New York Futures Exchange (NYFE), and the former American Stock Exchange. To support the exchanges, many brokerage firms had offices ""clustered around Wall Street"". The direct economic impacts of Wall Street activities extend beyond New York City.
Wall Street physically contains several banking headquarters and skyscrapers, as well as the Federal Hall National Memorial. The street is served by three subway stations and a ferry stop.",

It was built between 1909 and 1912 and was designed by Raymond F. Almirall in the Beaux-Arts style. The building occupies a slightly irregular lot bounded by Chambers Street to the south, Elk Street to the east, and Reade Street to the north.
49 Chambers was the largest bank building in the United States upon its completion. It was the first skyscraper to use the ""H"" layout, which provided light and air to more parts of the building. The basement through second floor fill the entire lot, while the third through fifteenth floors contain the ""H"" layout and are designed to resemble a pair of towers. The facade is made largely of Indiana Limestone, as well as some brick and granite. Inside, the first and second floors constitute a former banking hall, used as an event space. The upper floors were used as offices before being converted to 99 residential condominiums.
The current building is the third built by the Emigrant Savings Bank on the same site; the bank had previously erected structures in 1858 and 1885–1887. 49 Chambers' banking hall was occupied by the bank until 1969, while office tenants took space in the upper floors. The building was subsequently owned by the government of New York City until 2013, and was converted in 2017 to condominiums. 49 Chambers was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and both the exterior and the first floor interior were designated New York City landmarks in 1985.

Mulliken and Moeller had recently finished The Lucerne, on the corner of 79th and Amsterdam Avenue, and the Bretton Hall hotel on the east side of Broadway from 85th to 86th Streets. When Mulliken and Moeller began working on the Central Park View in 1905 for an investor group known only as the Monticello Realty Company, they were also designing the Severn and Van Dyck apartments (found on the east side of Amsterdam Avenue between 72nd and 73rd streets) for a separate client. In the following year, Mulliken and Moeller designed Rossleigh Court, the adjoining and similarly designed apartment building located on the northwest corner of 85th Street and Central Park West. In 1909, Dr. H. F. L. Ziegel and his wife, Beatrice, added the adjoining Neo-Georgian residence at 8 West 86th StreetSituated opposite the 86th Street transverse to Central Park West on the southwest corner, the Central Park View's design followed the popular “French Flat” model in a Beaux Arts-style, modified to conform to the size of a twelve-story structure. Upon its completion, the new hotel anchored the eastern end of the developing West 86th Street. On the western end of West 86th Street, the Columbia Yacht Club had relocated to a site adjoining the Hudson River in 1874 and remained the other West 86th Street bookend until 1937.257 Central Park West is located within the Upper West Side-Central Park West Historic District, designated on April 24, 1990.

Designed by Cass Gilbert in the Beaux-Arts style, it is at 1 Bowling Green in the Financial District near the southern tip of Manhattan in New York City, roughly on the same spot as Fort Amsterdam and Government House.
The Custom House was proposed in 1889 as a replacement for the previous New York Custom House at 55 Wall Street. Due to various disagreements, the Bowling Green Custom House was not approved until 1899; Gilbert was selected as an architect following a competition. The building was officially opened in 1907, and the murals in the rotunda were added during a Works Progress Administration project in 1938. The United States Customs Service moved out of the building in 1974, and it sat abandoned for over a decade until renovations in the late 1980s. In 1990, the Custom House was renamed to commemorate Alexander Hamilton, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and its first Secretary of the Treasury.
The building contains the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian, which opened in 1994, as well as the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Since 2012, it is also the home to the National Archives at New York City. The exterior of the U.S. Custom House was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1965, while part of the interior was similarly designated in 1979. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and was named a National Historic Landmark in 1976.

Serving as the headquarters of the City Investing Company, it was on Cortlandt Street between Church Street and Broadway in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. The building was designed by Francis Kimball and constructed by the Hedden Construction Company.
Because of the area's sloping topography, the City Investing Building rose 32 stories above Broadway and 33 stories above Church Street, excluding an attic. The bulk of the building was 26 stories high above Church Street and was capped by a seven-story central portion with gable roofs. The building had an asymmetrical F-shaped footprint with a light court facing Cortlandt Street, as well as a wing to Broadway that wrapped around a real estate holdout, the Gilsey Building. Inside was a massive lobby stretching between Broadway and Church Street. The upper stories each contained between 5,200 and 19,500 square feet (480 and 1,810 m2) of space on each floor.
Work on the City Investing Building started in 1906, and it opened in 1908 with about 12 acres (49,000 m2; 520,000 sq ft) of floor area, becoming one of New York City's largest office buildings at the time.

The City Investing Building was sold to Grigori Benenson in 1919 and renamed the Benenson Building. After Benenson was unable to pay the mortgage, it was sold twice in the 1930s. The building was renamed 165 Broadway by 1938 and was renovated in 1941. The City Investing Building and the adjacent Singer Building were razed in 1968 to make room for One Liberty Plaza, which had more than twice the floor area than the two former buildings combined.

The house was originally built for the Civic Club in 1898–1899, having been designed by Brooklyn architect Thomas A. Gray. The Civic Club was founded by the local social reformer F. Norton Goddard (1861–1905) to reduce poverty and fight against gambling in the neighborhood. After Goddard's death in 1905 the club ceased to exist, but the building remained in the Goddard family until 1946, when Frederick Norton's widow sold it for $25,000 to The New York Estonian Educational Society, Inc., which is still the owner of the house today. The building underwent a $100,000 restoration in 1992.Known as the Estonian House (Eesti Maja), the building houses a number of Estonian organizations such as the New York Estonian School (New Yorgi Eesti Kool), choruses for men and women and a folk dancing group. Vaba Eesti Sõna, the largest Estonian-language newspaper in the United States is also published at the New York Estonian House. The Estonian House has become the main center of Estonian culture on the U.S. Eastern seaboard, especially amongst Estonian-Americans.
The building was designated as a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1978 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Civic-club1.jpg/225px-Civic-club1.jpg

It also contains a connection to the New York City Subway at Grand Central–42nd Street station. The terminal is the third-busiest train station in North America, after New York Penn Station and Toronto Union Station.
The distinctive architecture and interior design of Grand Central Terminal's station house have earned it several landmark designations, including as a National Historic Landmark. Its Beaux-Arts design incorporates numerous works of art. Grand Central Terminal is one of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions, with 21.6 million visitors in 2018, excluding train and subway passengers. The terminal's main concourse is often used as a meeting place, and is especially featured in films and television. Grand Central Terminal contains a variety of stores and food vendors, including a food court on its lower-level concourse.
Grand Central Terminal was built by and named for the New York Central Railroad; it also served the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and, later, successors to the New York Central. Opened in 1913, the terminal was built on the site of two similarly-named predecessor stations, the first of which dates to 1871. Grand Central Terminal served intercity trains until 1991, when Amtrak began routing its trains through nearby Penn Station. The East Side Access project, which will bring Long Island Rail Road service to a new station beneath the terminal, is expected to be completed in late 2022.
Grand Central covers 48 acres (19 ha) and has 44 platforms, more than any other railroad station in the world. Its platforms, all below ground, serve 30 tracks on the upper level and 26 on the lower. In total, there are 67 tracks, including a rail yard and sidings; of these, 43 tracks are in use for passenger service, while the remaining two dozen are used to store trains. Another eight tracks and four platforms are being built on two new levels deep underneath the existing station as part of East Side Access.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Image-Grand_central_Station_Outside_Night_2.jpg/300px-Image-Grand_central_Station_Outside_Night_2.jpg

The hotel was named after Henry Roger Wolcott, a businessman, politician, and philanthropist.

Before it was even completed, the building was leased by Dewey to James H. Breslin, a prominent hotelier of the time, for three years. Nonetheless, Dewey had difficulty with the financing for the building: unable to purchase steel locally, he imported it from Europe, which caused an unusually long construction period, which in turn made it difficult for Dewey to pay his creditors. In early 1905 The American Mortgage Company repossessed the building, which was sold at auction. Breslin's lease remained, but the hotel passed through the hands of a series of owners in the following decades.

The hotel was popular with travelers, but also housed many permanent residents, including dancer Isadora Duncan and Doris Duke, the heiress. Other prominent guests of the hotel included Edith Wharton and Henry Miller, and Buddy Holly and the Everly Brothers stayed there while recording at Beltone Studios, which was in the building.

The name ""Knickerbocker"" is an iconic Dutch surname associated with New York City. Prominent longtime residents of the hotel included Enrico Caruso and George M. Cohan. Built by John Jacob Astor IV (1864–1912) as a showcase of luxury in a time of prosperity, the hostelry closed 15 years later because of financial decline.
The hotel was converted to offices in 1920 and was known as The Knickerbocker Building. It was the home of Newsweek magazine (1940–59) and became the Newsweek Building. After major renovations in 1980 it became known as 1466 Broadway and was used for many years as garment showrooms and offices. During this period it was later known as 6 Times Square. It was converted back to use as a hotel in 2013–15 under its original name.
The building is in the Beaux-Arts style, constructed of red brick with terracotta details and a prominent mansard roof. The architects were Marvin & Davis, with Bruce Price as consultant, and it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and designated a New York City Landmark in 1988.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/6_Times_Square_42_morning_red_brick_jeh.jpg/250px-6_Times_Square_42_morning_red_brick_jeh.jpg

The building was sold at least twice. In 1926, the Manhattan Life Insurance Company sold the building to Frederick Brown, who then re-sold it to the Manufacturer's Trust Company a few weeks later.

Schwarzman Building, commonly known as the Main Branch or the New York Public Library, is the flagship building in the New York Public Library system and a landmark in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The branch, one of four research libraries in the library system, contains nine separate divisions. The structure contains four stories open to the public. The main entrance steps are at Fifth Avenue at its intersection with East 41st Street. As of 2015, the branch contains an estimated 2.5 million volumes in its stacks. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark, a National Register of Historic Places site, and a New York City designated landmark in the 1960s.
The Main Branch was built after the New York Public Library was formed as a combination of two libraries in the late 1890s. The site, along Fifth Avenue between 40th and 42nd Streets, is located directly east of Bryant Park, on the site of the Croton Reservoir. The architectural firm Carrère and Hastings constructed the structure in the Beaux-Arts style, and the structure opened on May 23, 1911. The marble facade of the building contains ornate detailing, and the Fifth Avenue entrance is flanked by a pair of stone lions that serve as the library's icon. The interior of the building contains the Main Reading Room, a space measuring 78 by 297 feet (24 by 91 m) with a 52-foot-high (16 m) ceiling; a Public Catalog Room; and various reading rooms, offices, and art exhibitions.
The Main Branch became popular after its opening, and saw 4 million annual visitors by the 1920s. It formerly contained a circulating library, though the circulating division of the Main Branch moved to the nearby Mid-Manhattan Library in 1970. Additional space for the library's stacks was constructed under adjacent Bryant Park in 1991, and the branch's Main Reading Room was restored in 1998. A major restoration from 2007 to 2011 was underwritten by a $100 million gift from philanthropist Stephen A. Schwarzman, for whom the branch was subsequently renamed. Since 2018, the branch has been undergoing an additional expansion that is expected to be completed in 2021.
The Main Branch has been featured in many television shows, including Seinfeld and Sex and the City, as well as films such as The Wiz in 1978, Ghostbusters in 1984, and The Day After Tomorrow in 2004.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/New_York_Public_Library_May_2011.JPG/300px-New_York_Public_Library_May_2011.JPG

The station occupied an 8-acre (3.2 ha) plot bounded by Seventh and Eighth Avenues and 31st and 33rd Streets in Midtown Manhattan. As the terminal shared its name with several stations in other cities, it was sometimes called New York Pennsylvania Station, or Penn Station for short.
The building was designed by McKim, Mead, and White and completed in 1910, enabling direct rail access to New York City from the south for the first time.  Its head house and train shed were considered a masterpiece of the Beaux-Arts style and one of the great architectural works of New York City. The station contained 11 platforms serving 21 tracks, in approximately the same layout as the current Penn Station. The original building was one of the first stations to include separate waiting rooms for arriving and departing passengers, and when built, these were among the city's largest public spaces.
Passenger traffic began to decline after World War II, and in the 1950s, the Pennsylvania Railroad sold the air rights to the property and shrank the railroad station. Starting in 1963, the above-ground head house and train shed were demolished, a loss that galvanized the modern historic preservation movement in the United States. Over the next six years, the below-ground concourses and waiting areas were heavily renovated, becoming the modern Penn Station, while Madison Square Garden and Pennsylvania Plaza were built above them. The sole remaining portions of the original station are the underground platforms and tracks, as well as scattered artifacts on the mezzanine level above it.

Penn Station has 21 tracks fed by seven tunnels (the two North River Tunnels, the four East River Tunnels, and the single Empire Connection tunnel). It is at the center of the Northeast Corridor, a passenger rail line that connects New York City with Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and intermediate points. Intercity trains are operated by Amtrak, which owns the station, while commuter rail services are operated by the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and NJ Transit (NJT). Connections are available within the complex to the New York City Subway, and buses.

The building was commissioned by Frederick Gilbert Bourne, leader of the Singer Company, and designed in multiple phases by architect Ernest Flagg, an early proponent of the Beaux-Arts architectural style, from 1897 to 1908.
The completed Singer Building was composed of a 14-story base covering the entire land lot, as well as a tower rising an additional 27 stories above a small section of the base. Included in the base were the original Singer Building at 149 Broadway, the Bourne Building on Liberty Street, and subsequent additions to both buildings. The facade was made of brick, stone, and terracotta, and the tower was capped by a dome with a lantern. The foundation of the tower was excavated to the underlying bedrock, while the base rested on relatively shallow foundations. The Singer Building used a steel skeleton, though the original structure was initially supported by load-bearing walls prior to modification. When completed, the building had a large lobby, 16 elevators, and an observatory.
The original 10-story Singer Building was erected between 1897 and 1898, while the 14-story Bourne Building was built adjacent to it from 1898 to 1899. The Singer Building's tower was built between 1906 and 1908 as part of another expansion, and both original buildings were expanded, becoming the base of an enlarged Singer Building.

The building was designed in the Beaux Arts style by John Rochester Thomas, as well as Arthur J. Horgan and Vincent J. Slattery. It faces City Hall Park and Tweed Courthouse to the south, and the Manhattan Municipal Building to the east.
The Surrogate's Courthouse consists of a seven-story, steel-framed structure with a granite facade and elaborate marble interiors. It was designed to be fireproof in order to safely house the city's paper records. The exterior contains fifty-four sculptures by prize-winning artists, as well as a three-story Corinthian-style colonnade on Chambers and Reade Streets. The building houses the city's Municipal Archives in the basement, and courtrooms for the Surrogate's Court for New York County on the fifth floor.
The Hall of Records building had been planned since the late 19th century to replace an outdated building in City Hall Park, and plans for the current building were approved in 1897. Construction took place between 1899 and 1907, having experienced several delays because of controversies over funding, sculptures, and Horgan and Slattery's involvement after Thomas's 1901 death. The building was renamed the Surrogate's Courthouse in 1962, and over the years, has undergone few alterations. The Surrogate's Courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark, and its facade and interior are both New York City designated landmarks.

Van Tassell and Kearney Horse Auction Mart,40.73277777999999926805685390718281269073486328125,-73.989166670000003023233148269355297088623046875,"The Van Tassell and Kearney Horse Auction Mart is a building in East Village, Manhattan, New York City. The building was constructed in 1903-04 to the designs of Jardine, Kent & Jardine in the Beaux-Arts Style. It originally served as a horse auction mart that catered to New York's elite families, including the Vanderbilts and Delanos. Each Tuesday and Friday, Van Tassell & Kearney held auctions in the building. Though carriages remained an important part of the business, most advertisements and newspaper stories about the mart concerned the sale of horses, particularly high-priced ribbon winners, polo ponies, hunters, and thoroughbreds. Other sales were devoted to breeding stock and coach horses, including a large group of horses co-owned by Alfred W. Vanderbilt and Robert L. Gerry in 1906.As automobiles and other forms of public transit became much more common after World War I, the practical need for horses and stables decreased.  The auction mart ceased functioning in the 13th Street building.  It served as an assembly-line training center for women during World War II.  From 1978 to 2005, artist Frank Stella owned the building and used it as his studio.  His nearly 30-year stewardship of the building resulted in the facade being cleaned and restored.In 2006, after discovering plans of a new owner to demolish the building and replace it with a condo development, the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation (GVSHP) asked the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) to hold an emergency hearing on the structure.  There was significant support for designation, including City Councilmember Rosie Mendez. Playing on the history of the building as an assembly line training center for women during World War II, GVSHP used the iconic ""We Can Do It!"" image (often associated with Rosie the Riveter) on stickers, flyers, and T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan ""We Can Save It! Landmark 128 East 13th Street"" as part of the campaign to secure landmark designation for the building. The LPC held a public hearing and halted demolition plans, but did not immediately designate the building.  On November 29, 2007, the building was listed on the State and National Register of Historic Places.  GVSHP and other advocates continued to push for designation.  In May 2012, after a 6-year campaign, the LPC voted unanimously to designate the former Van Tassell & Kearney Horse Auction Mart a New York City designated landmark.In January 2010 after an extensive renovation, Peridance Capezio Center opened here at its new location.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Peridance_128_E13_jeh.jpg/263px-Peridance_128_E13_jeh.jpg

It was designed by the architect George B. Post, and completed in 1875. The building served as headquarters for the Western Union telegraph company from 1875 until its destruction by fire in 1890, and was subsequently rebuilt in 1892 to designs by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh. The building was ten stories tall, rising to a height of 230 feet (70 m). It provided workspace for 100 telegraph operators and was staffed 24 hours a day.
The building was topped by a clock tower, and some claim that this building was the first skyscraper in New York City. Beginning in 1877, a time ball was dropped from the top of the building at exactly noon, triggered by a telegraph from the National Observatory in Washington, D.C. This system, invented by George May Phelps, was later used as the initial reference for Standard railway time in 1883, and would stay in use until 1912. The building's time ball would serve as an inspiration for One Times Square's New Year's Eve ""ball drop"", first held on December 31, 1907.The building was demolished from 1912 through 1914. It was replaced with the taller AT&T Headquarters at 195 Broadway. The Western Union Building annex at 14-18 Dey Street was demolished in 1912, and Western Union employees moved out of the old building to a new structure at 32 Avenue of the Americas in June 1914.
